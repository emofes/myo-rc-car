# myo-rc-car
myo gesture controlled rc car created during HackDFW 2015
 we used a myo - proccesing library created by NOK - https://github.com/nok/myo-processing
 this code can be used to control a servo attached to an arduino with myo gesture commands 
 through processing using a serial connection via usb
 
 Make sure you install the myo-proccing library created by NOK
